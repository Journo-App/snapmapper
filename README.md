okay so this is three versions of the same project

the main one is with some screwed up crazy stack but contains important code

jQueryMobile/ also contains valuable stuff but can't do server-side anything

snapmapper-new/ contains a simplified node.js setup. I'm not sure how to make it serve up client side scripts. But this should be pretty straightforward (and, critically, well documented)
